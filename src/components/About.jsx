        <h2>What inspired me to build this project</h2>
        <p>This project is for young children aged from 7 - 18 to allow them to get a clear understanding of how our solar system operates and give basic facts on all the planets that orbit the sun as well as facts about the sun itself. The 3d modelling would give the accurate orbits of the planets around the sun.</p>
